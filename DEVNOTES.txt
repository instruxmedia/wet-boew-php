Getting started with the WET-BOEW-PHP demo site

This documentation will help you get your first instance of WET-BOEW-PHP up and running. It assumes that you already have a working webserver that meets the minumum requirements.

From your webroot directory (root of your website's directory, sometimes also called www or htdocs), do the following commands:

    mkdir wetsite
    cd wetsite

    git clone https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-php.git
    cd wet-boew-php
    git checkout v4.0
    cd ..

    mkdir wet-boew-themes
    cd wet-boew-themes

    git clone -b theme-base --single-branch https://github.com/wet-boew/themes-dist.git theme-base
    git clone -b theme-GCWeb --single-branch https://github.com/wet-boew/themes-dist.git theme-gcweb
    git clone -b theme-gc-intranet --single-branch https://github.com/wet-boew/themes-dist.git theme-gc-intranet
    git clone -b theme-gcwu-fegc --single-branch https://github.com/wet-boew/themes-dist.git theme-gcwu-fegc
    git clone -b theme-ogpl --single-branch https://github.com/wet-boew/themes-dist.git theme-ogpl
    git clone -b v4.0-dist --single-branch  https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew-dist.git theme-wet-boew

Note 1: If you only want a particular theme, you can omit the other "git clone..." commands.
Note 2: WET-BOEW-PHP currently only includes support for theme-base, theme-gcwu-fegc and theme-wet-boew.

What you end up with is a directory structure that looks something like:

    wetconfig.php    (located one level up from wet-boew-php OR the root of your website)
    /wet-boew-php/   (clone of the wet-boew-php repo)
        demos-php/
        dist-php/

    /wet-boew-themes/theme-base/             |
    /wet-boew-themes/theme-gcwu-fegc/        |  Each of these is a clone of
    /wet-boew-themes/theme-gc-intranet/      |  the wet-boew-themes repo with
    /wet-boew-themes/theme-gcweb/            |  a different branch activated.
    /wet-boew-themes/theme-ogpl/             |
    /wet-boew-themes/theme-wet-boew/         | 
    etc...

TIPS For Theme Developers

When creating a new theme, each theme will require files to be added to the wet-boew-php directory tree. For example, when creating a theme called theme-custom, you would need to add the following directory branches:

/wet-boew-themes/theme-wet-boew/theme-custom
/wet-boew-php/dist-php/theme-custom
/wet-boew-php/dist-php/config/theme-custom

To add the new theme to the demos-php site, you would also need to add:

/wet-boew-php/demos-php/theme-custom

... and modify list of themes in the config-xx.php files in wet-boew-php/dist-php/config/ .

IMPORTANT: The PHP themes folders in wet-boew-php/dist-php/ must have the same names as in the core wet-boew-themes/ folders.

Known issues:

- Secondary Utility Menu Page - side menu doesn't work.
- Base theme - Footer should be grey, not red.
